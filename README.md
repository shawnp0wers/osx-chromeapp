# osx-chromeapp
Little script/app to create a standalone Google Chrome App on OSX. MUCH better than the built-in "app" thing in Chrome.


Download the scpt file, open it in Script Editor (in OSX). 

Have Google Chrome installed.

Click the "play" arrow.

Make app.

Celebrate.

Or don't. Icons seem to be broken in OSX Catalina. Like everything else in Catalina. Just click cancel and it should make an app with a generic icon.

This is a public domain script I got from a website that someone used to package a shell script that someone else wrote, blah blah blah. It works really well.
