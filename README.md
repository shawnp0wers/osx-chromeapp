# osx-chromeapp
Little script/app to create a standalone Google Chrome App on OSX. MUCH better than the built-in "app" thing in Chrome.


Download the scpt file, open it in Script Editor (in OSX). 

Have Google Chrome installed.

Click the "play" arrow.

Make app.

Celebrate.

This is a public domain script I got from a website that someone used to package a shell script that someone else wrote, blah blah blah. It works really well.
